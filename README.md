SPIFlash
========
Arduino/Moteino library for read/write access to SPI flash memory chips.
This works with 256byte/page SPI flash memory such as the 4MBIT W25X40CLSNIG used on (Moteinos)[www.moteino.com] for data storage and wireless programming.
<br/>
For instance a 4MBit (512Kbyte) flash chip will have 2048 pages: 256*2048 = 524288 bytes (512Kbytes).
<br/>Minimal modifications should allow chips that have different page size to work.
<br/>DEPENDS ON: Arduino *SPI library*.
<br/>
This library was primarily developed to enable **safe** wireless programming on Moteino nodes and Moteino based applications such as the SwitchMote. This has been documented at [lowpowerlab](http://lowpowerlab.com/blog/category/moteino/wireless-programming/). [Dualoptiboot](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/DualOptiboot) (all Moteinos come with it) and [WirelessProgramming library](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/WirelessProgramming) are required to be able to wirelessly re-flash a remote Moteino.

This fork is for Spansion 32Mbit S25FL032P support.
