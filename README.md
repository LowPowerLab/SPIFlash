Arduino/Moteino library for read/write access to SPI flash memory chips.
This works with 256byte/page SPI flash memory such as the [4MBIT W25X40CLSNIG](https://lowpowerlab.com/shop/product/72) used on [Moteino](https://www.moteino.com) for data storage and wireless programming.
<br/>
For instance a 4MBit (512Kbyte) flash chip will have 2048 pages: 256*2048 = 524288 bytes (512Kbytes).
<br/>Minimal modifications should allow chips that have different page size to work.
<br/>DEPENDS ON: Arduino native *SPI library*.
<br/>
This library was primarily developed to enable **safe** wireless programming on Moteino nodes and Moteino based applications such as the [SwitchMote](https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/switchmote/). This has been documented at [lowpowerlab](https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/moteino/wireless-programming/). [Dualoptiboot](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/DualOptiboot) (all AVR based Moteinos come with it) and [RFM69_OTA WirelessProgramming library](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69) are required to be able to wirelessly re-flash a remote Moteino.
 
### Installation
